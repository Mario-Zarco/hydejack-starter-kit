My name is Mario. I am the grandson of Juana, and the son of Begonia and Esau. 

I am POC scholar who was raised in the barrio. 

I am from Mexico, but I have been based in TƒÅmaki Makaurau, Aotearoa for almost 6 years.

I obtained my PhD at the University of Auckland supervised by [Dr Matthew Egbert](https://www.matthewegbert.com/){:target="_blank"} and co-supervised by [Dr Christopher Erb](https://www.cmndlab.com/people/){:target="_blank"}   and Dr Claire Postlethwaite. 

I am interested in a wide range of topics.
